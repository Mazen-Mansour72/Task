Drop an outlier if:
You know that it’s wrong:
For example, if you have a really good sense of what range the data should fall in, like people’s ages, you can safely drop values that are outside of that range.

You have a lot of data:
so your sample won’t be hurt by dropping a questionable outlier.

You can go back and recollect or verify the questionable data point.
                          ----------------------------------------------------
Don’t drop an outlier if:
Your results are critical,
so even small changes will matter a lot. For example, you can feel better about dropping outliers about people’s favorite TV shows, not about the temperatures at which airplane seals fail.

There are a lot of outliers.
Outliers are rare by definition. If, for example, 30% of your data is outliers, then it actually means that there’s something interesting going on with your data that you need to look further into.
